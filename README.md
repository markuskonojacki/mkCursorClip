I've moved this little project over from codeplex to github to save it. I've written it in 2012 but it still works.

# Project Description

This handy little tool provides a keyboard shortcut to trap your cursor in a window, be it a game or any other program.

# Features

- Configurable hotkeys
- Configurable padding from application border
- Simple and lightweight
- Uses modified version of http://keyboardmousehooks.codeplex.com/ for hotkey handling (link is probably dead when you read this, I've found no new repo for it)

# How-to

It's pretty simple.

- Download the current release
- Start it
- Press the configured hotkeys (default is left-shift + <) and watch your cursor struggle to come out of the current window!
- Optional: Right-click the tray icon and configure it for your own needs in the settings dialog
